All about me learning Python the hard way

Hi this is Duc and i'm on a journey to learn Python.
This is my 3rd attempt at this book by Zed Shaw.
My previous 2 attempts ended in me getting fed up and giving up before I even tried.
This time around, I will do it with self-discipline.
It will be hard, but I hope I will pull through.
