# Ex 11:
# Use a comma (,) at the end of a 'print' line so that 'print' does not end the line with a newline character.

# Ex 16:
# List of commands for reading & writing files:
#   close -- closes the file object
#   read -- reads the contents of the file; can assign output to a variable; use <var>.read()
#   readline -- reads just 1 line of a text file
#   truncate -- empties the file object; use <var>.truncate()
#   write('stuff') -- writes "stuff" to the file

# Ex 20:
# x = x + y can be shorthanded to x += y

# Ex 22:
# return function stores output values of a function in 'temporary' variables that can be passed into explicitly declared variables
# or can be passed into % format codes (%d, %r, etc.)

# Ex 35:
# Study drill 1: validating input from raw_input; value from raw_input is a string, so in order to evaluate that value, it needs to
# be converted to a number. An "x in y" operator can check the input string, but the 'x' must be string as well.
# Study drill 2: using a for-loop with an else-statement, need to be careful not to indent the else-statement, otherwise, the
# if-statement will (somehow???) not evaluated.
