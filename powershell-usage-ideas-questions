#To create a file in Powershell:
  new-item <name> -type file

#To copy a folder (along with all subfolders and files in it):
  cp -recurse <copied folder> <new folder's name> 
#'-recurse' can be shortened to just '-r'

#'rmdir' removes a folder but will prompt if it is not empty.
#'rm -r' removes a folder without any prompt.

#To save current directory's path to return to later:
  pushd
#To return to the saved path:
  popd
#Simple but very convenient!
